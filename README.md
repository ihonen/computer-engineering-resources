# Literary recommendations for aspiring computer engineers (including myself)

## What is this collection? Whom is it for?

This is a collection of literature that
- I have read and had a particularly satisfying learning experience with **or**
- I haven't read but I plan to read and expect to learn a lot

This collection does **not** even attempt to be an all-encompassing list of books computer engineering students should read - it is simply a collection of books for intermediate/advanced students that I happened to think are worth a mention.
